In case it isn't abundantly clear : I didn't make the graphics for this MASTERPIECE.
> Player is Ramona Flowers from "Scott Pilgrim vs the world" (X360/PS3)
> The pigs are from the same game
> The blood explosion is from Metal Slug (3 I think, but they're the same in all the games)
> Background is a screenshot from "Spliter Cell Chaos Theory" I found funny
> The evil cherry is from "I wanna be the guy". 
BUT : I made the spike (because I couldn't quickly google the sprite of the spikes from "I wanna be the guy")

So enjoy this thing. I hear the tutorial is even harder than cuphead's.
